# Idea

The two meeples are symmetric, only one needs to be considered. The game setting is that an optimistic player(OP) and a pessimistic player(PE) play the same meeple alternatively. OP wants to minize the total steps while PE wants the opposite. The subgoal is to compute the total steps needed.

Afterwards we only need to compare the steps needed when starting from different positions.

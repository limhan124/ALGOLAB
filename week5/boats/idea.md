# Idea

Given that we put every boat as close to the left as possible, greedily add a boat that minimize the right margin(right edge of that boat) until the end.

Invariant will be that we always added a number of boats with a minimal length.

# Remark

Sometimes try to consider a 1-D in a greedy manner, if the DP approach seems not correct.
